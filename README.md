# mOS - Minimal Operating System

This is a small operating system currently under development. I am using the following references while learning how to put this project together:

- [The little book about OS development](https://littleosbook.github.io/)
- [OS Dev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page)
- [Writing a Simple Operating System from Scratch](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf)
